Six Flags is a chain of amusement parks and water parks that mainly operate throughout the continental United States.

Like most amusement parks, Six Flags sells season passes for their parks. These are usually purchased by locals that live close by to the park, or people that simply want to visit the park more then one time per season.

Unfortunately, these Season Passes and even tickets can be quite expensive, for example, Magic Mountain's season pass **AND** tickets costs **$92.99 dollars each**.

However, unlike other chains, such as Cedar Fair, **all Six Flags season passes are valid at all non-water parks.** This means you can use a Fiesta Texas season pass at Magic Mountain for example.

This got me thinking, what is the cheapest season pass you can get at a Six Flags park? This repository is the answer to that question.

Included in this repository is a scrapper that goes to all of the non-water park season pass pages, and collects the data of season prices to make a table that you can easily look at.

Here are the top three cheapest season passes according to the generated table:

| Park                | Season Pass Price           |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Six Flags Mexico    | $729.00 MXN (About $32 USD) |
| La Ronde            | $56.99 CAD (About $41 USD)  |
| Six Flags St. Louis | $59.99 USD                  |

Six Flags Mexico has the cheapest season pass being around $32, **that's almost 3x times cheaper then even buying a Magic Mountain ticket.** 

The cheapest Season Pass for a United States Six Flags park is Six Flags St. Louis at $59.99.

Below is the full table, so you can see all of the Six Flags season pass prices.
